Structural Elements
===================

Section Title
-------------

That's it, the text just above this line.

Transitions
-----------

Here's a transition:

---------

It divides the section.

Body Elements
=============

Paragraphs
----------

A paragraph.

Inline Markup
`````````````

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, ``inline literals``, standalone hyperlinks
(https://www.python.org), external hyperlinks (Python_), internal
cross-references (example_), external hyperlinks with embedded URIs
(`Python web site <https://www.python.org>`__), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled
auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references
([CIT2002]_), substitution references (|example|), and _`inline
hyperlink targets` (see Targets_ below for a reference back to here).
Character-level inline markup is also possible (although exceedingly
ugly!) in *re*\ ``Structured``\ *Text*.  Problems are indicated by
|problematic| text (generated by processing errors; this one is
intentional).

The default role for interpreted text is `Title Reference`.  Here are
some explicit interpreted text roles: a PEP reference (:PEP:`287`); an
RFC reference (:RFC:`2822`); a :sub:`subscript`; a :sup:`superscript`;
and explicit roles for :emphasis:`standard` :strong:`inline`
:literal:`markup`.

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a
live link to PEP 258 here.

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records.  They are often part of an extension syntax.  They are
       an unambiguous variant of RFC 2822 fields.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?

Line Blocks
-----------

| This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
|     Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
  they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
|     The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
  the left edge of the text above it.

| This is a second line block.
|
| Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

    | A one, two, a one two three four

    | Half a bee, philosophically,
    |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
    | But half the bee has got to be,
    |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
    |
    | But can a bee be said to be
    |     or not to be an entire bee,
    |         when half the bee is not a bee,
    |             due to some ancient injury?
    |
    | Singing...

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.

Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_, and a [nonexistent]_
citation.

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_".

.. _Python: https://www.python.org

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_, which generates an
error.

Duplicate Target Names
``````````````````````

Duplicate names in section headers or other implicit targets will
generate "info" (level-1) system messages.  Duplicate names in
explicit targets will generate "warning" (level-2) system messages.

Duplicate Target Names
``````````````````````

Since there are two "Duplicate Target Names" section headers, we
cannot uniquely refer to either of them by name.  If we try to (like
this: `Duplicate Target Names`_), an error is generated.

Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

These are just a sample of the many reStructuredText Directives.  For
others, please see
https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html.

Document Parts
``````````````

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(a local, untitled table of contents_) and at the beginning of the
document (a document-wide `table of contents`_).

Images
``````

An image directive (also clickable -- a hyperlink reference):

.. image:: images/title.png
   :target: directives_

A figure directive:

.. figure:: images/title.png
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Structured | Structure-enhanced text, structuredtext.      |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Text       | Well it is, isn't it?                         |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   This paragraph is also part of the legend.

Admonitions
```````````

.. Attention:: Directives at large.

.. Caution::

   Don't take any wooden nickels.

.. DANGER:: Mad scientist at work!

.. Error:: Does not compute.

.. Hint:: It's bigger than a bread box.

.. Important::
   - Wash behind your ears.
   - Clean up your room.
   - Call your mother.
   - Back up your data.

.. Note:: This is a note.

.. Tip:: 15% if the service is good.

.. WARNING:: Strong prose may provoke extreme mental exertion.
   Reader discretion is strongly advised.

.. admonition:: And, by the way...

   You can make up your own admonition too.

Topics, Sidebars, and Rubrics
`````````````````````````````

.. sidebar:: Optional Sidebar Title
   :subtitle: Optional Subtitle

   This is a sidebar.  It is for text outside the flow of the main
   text.

   .. rubric:: This is a rubric inside a sidebar

   Sidebars often appears beside the main text with a border and
   background color.

.. topic:: Topic Title

   This is a topic.

.. rubric:: This is a rubric

Target Footnotes
````````````````

.. target-notes::

Replacement Text
````````````````

I recommend you try |Python|_.

.. |Python| replace:: Python, *the* best language around

Compound Paragraph
``````````````````

.. compound::

   This paragraph contains a literal block::

       Connecting... OK
       Transmitting data... OK
       Disconnecting... OK

   and thus consists of a simple paragraph, a literal block, and
   another simple paragraph.  Nonetheless it is semantically *one*
   paragraph.

This construct is called a *compound paragraph* and can be produced
with the "compound" directive.

Meta
````

The `“meta” directive`__ is used to specify metadata to be stored in,
e.g., HTML META__ tags or ODT file properties.

.. meta::
   :keywords: reStructuredText, test, parser
   :description lang=en: A test document, containing at least one
       example of each reStructuredText construct.

Substitution Definitions
------------------------

An inline image (|example|) example:

.. |EXAMPLE| image:: images/biohazard.png

(Substitution definitions are not visible in the HTML source.)

Comments
--------

Here's one:

.. Comments begin with two dots and a space. Anything may
   follow, except for the syntax of footnotes, hyperlink
   targets, directives, or substitution definitions.

   Double-dashes -- "--" -- must be escaped somehow in HTML output.

(View the HTML source to see the comment.)

Error Handling
==============

Any errors caught during processing will generate system messages.

|*** Expect 6 errors (including this one). ***|

There should be six messages in the following, auto-generated
section, "Docutils System Messages":

.. section should be added by Docutils automatically
